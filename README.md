# MATH-292-Final-Project
 An implementation of NEAT for RL tasks in Gym
 
 Some useful tips and links to getting started:
1. All notebooks work out of the box, so long as you have the required dependencies. Either refer to the list below, or just pull up pip to install the modules listed in the import cell of each notebook.
2. https://gym.openai.com/docs/ <-- Basic setup of OpenAI-Gym (Need Atari and Box2D)
3. https://medium.com/@sayanmndl21/install-openai-gym-with-box2d-and-mujoco-in-windows-10-e25ee9b5c1d5 <-- setting up Gym with Box2D
4. I do not use the MujoCo dependencies, instead I use the PyBulletGym module by benelot: https://github.com/benelot/pybullet-gym
5. https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ <-- PySimpleGUI for the trial window info
