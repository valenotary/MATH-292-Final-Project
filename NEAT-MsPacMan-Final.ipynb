    "# Some Notes\n",
    "Here are some things about which knobs you can turn in each cell:\n",
    "1. Imports. Don't touch anything there unless you wanna try something out at your own risk.\n",
    "2. Environment Declarations. Change the envName string if you want to test out other environments, but just note that you may need to change some other parameters in the evaluation cell as well if you do so.\n",
    "3. Hyperparameters. Change as you please, but I would recommend sticking to the values from the NEAT paper and/or neatevolve.lua.\n",
    "4. Some functions. I wouldn't touch this.\n",
    "5. Genome Class. I wouldn't touch this, but please feel free to look at the mess I've made. I have recently moved the crossover and delta functions as static methods to this class.\n",
    "8. Evaluation. As mentioned in 2), if you change the environment, then you made need to change the evaluateAction method of the genome or some of the target fitness requirements for episode termination."
